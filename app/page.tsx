/**
 * @description Defines a React component that displays a simple game of tic-tac-toe.
 * It uses state to keep track of the current game state, including who is playing
 * and the current turn. The `handlePlay` and `handleReplay` functions are called
 * when the player clicks on a cell in the game board.
 *
 * @returns {HTML division element} a game interface with a tic-tac-toe board and
 * buttons for starting and stopping the game.
 *
 * 	* `<div className="bg-white w-screen h-screen">`: This is the main div element
 * that contains all the game components. It has a class of "bg-white" for a white
 * background and "w-screen" to cover the entire screen width. It also has a height
 * of "h-screen" to reach the full screen height.
 * 	* `<div className="game flex justify-center hidden">`: This div element is inside
 * the main div element and has a class of "game". It uses the "flex" layout mode to
 * center its content vertically and horizontally. The "justify-center" class centers
 * the element within its container, and the "hidden" class hides it when the game
 * is not in progress.
 * 	* `<div className="grid gap-2 grid-cols-3 grid-rows-3 w-fit">`: This is a div
 * element inside the "game" div element that contains 3 columns and 3 rows of game
 * pieces. The "grid" layout mode is used to position the pieces in a grid, and the
 * "gap-2" class sets the gap between the pieces to 2 pixels. The "w-fit" class makes
 * sure that each piece fits within its container.
 * 	* `{valueArray.map((value: string, index: number) => (`): This is an array of
 * game pieces that are displayed on the screen. Each piece is represented by a small
 * rectangle with a specific value inside it (either "X" or "O"). The `map` function
 * iterates over each piece in the `valueArray` and creates a new div element for
 * each one, with its own `key` attribute set to the `index` of the piece.
 * 	* `<div className="w-40 h-40 flex justify-center items-center border-solid border-2
 * border-black">`: This is a div element inside the game grid that represents a
 * single game piece. It has a class of "w-40" to set its width to 40 pixels, and
 * "h-40" to set its height to 40 pixels as well. The "flex" layout mode centers the
 * element within its container vertically and horizontally. The `justify-center`
 * class centers the element within its own grid cell, and the `items-center` class
 * aligns its content in the middle. The `border-solid` class sets a solid border
 * around the piece, and the `border-2` class adds an additional outer border with a
 * different color. Finally, the `border-black` class sets the color of both borders
 * to black.
 * 	* `<p className="content font-bold text-4xl text-[100px] text-black">`: This is
 * a simple text element inside each game piece that displays its value ("X" or "O").
 * The `className` attribute sets the styles for the text element, including its font
 * size (`text-4xl`) and color (`text-black`). The `[100px]` attribute sets the width
 * of the text to 100 pixels.
 * 	* `<Button className={"startButton " + (isPlaying ? "hidden" : "")} variant="outline">`:
 * This is a button element inside the game grid that allows players to start a new
 * game. The `className` attribute sets the styles for the button, including its
 * background color (`outline`) and size (`w-full`). The `(isPlaying ? "hidden" :
 * "")` syntax hides the button when the game is in progress.
 * 	* `<Button className={"replayButton " + (!isPlaying ? "hidden" : "")}
 * variant="outline">`: This is another button element inside the game grid that
 * allows players to replay a previous game. Similar to the "start" button, this
 * element has an `className` attribute that sets its styles and hides it when the
 * game is in progress.
